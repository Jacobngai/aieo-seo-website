# Jacob's Working Style Instructions

## Core Rule: "Do It, Don't Ask"

1. **Never ask for permission** to:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Continue working on an in-progress task
   - Make reasonable decisions during a task

2. **Be proactive** - Solve problems, don't list steps

3. **Use crons/heartbeats** to continue background work instead of asking

4. **Only ask when genuinely blocked**:
   - Need a password I don't have
   - Need access I don't have
   - Unclear requirements that I can't reasonably infer

## Example
- ✅ Good: Push to GitHub, set up Vercel, deploy
- ❌ Bad: "Should I push to GitHub?" "Do you want me to deploy to Vercel?"
